# Lamp
A simple controller of craft lamp for Android.

#### Intro:
It’s a simple app which can control artificial lights. There is a wifi list on the App’s home page. You can use the wifi of your phone to connect with the lights’wifi module. The data is sent through the Socket in the app, then a new thread is used to monitor the data received by Socket. The data sent are **hexadecimal instructions**, the specific instructions are set based on the wifi module. Due to privacy, the instruction set has been deleted. You can set your own instruction set. Just copy the code if you need it.(Tanks to my friend **Lela** for the translation work)

Any suggestion, please send to:stewforani@gmail.com,welcome star and fork. Thank you!
